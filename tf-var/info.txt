let's say in a file we have around 20-30 variable during execution time it's going to ask a lot of stuff and during run time we have another option like passing variables in run time but that will also be headache with so many variable.

For resolving this we have tf-vars like how we can pass such variable data.  

terraform.tfvars


in the above file define your variable data that you want to pass and please dont change the terraform.tfvars to anyother thing.

Agar execution k time par you are providing run time variable so it will consider that ignore the  terraform.tfvars else it will take data from it.
